# hypershuffle
*Hyper* shuffle. Way better than your normal shuffle.

I wrote this as a response to [Daily Programmery EASY 224][challenge]. It's an idea I've had in mind for shuffling items for a long time, but I never got around to doing it before.

I'm pretty sure, if I'm honest, that the actual shuffling code could be made *way* more efficient... But I'm over it. :)
